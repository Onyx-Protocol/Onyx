# Chain Protocol specification

## Introduction

This is the technical specification for the Chain Protocol. It describes the entities and their relationships, the data structures and encoding formats, and the operations necessary to run a fully functional node in a blockchain network. The reader is assumed to have knowledge of basic cryptographic concepts such as cryptographic hashes and public key cryptography.

A companion document, the [Chain Protocol whitepaper](../papers/whitepaper.md), includes motivation for the design choices, usage notes and other discussion.

Chain, Inc. provides production-grade software called [Chain Core](https://chain.com/core) that implements a network node as defined in this specification.
