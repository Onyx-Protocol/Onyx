# Chain Core Product Roadmap

Chain Core is a collaborative effort. Together with our partners and the wider development community, we are working to re-invent the foundation of financial services. To help you gain insights into our process, we are publishing this product roadmap. It is intended to be an indicator of our priorities, but not a commitment to features, timeline, or order of implementation.

If you have feature requests or feedback, we want to hear from you. Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/chain), [Slack](https://slack.chain.com), or the [Chain developer forum](https://support.chain.com).

**Note:** This roadmap focuses on Chain Core features and does not cover protocol improvements, which are discussed separately in the [Protocol Roadmap](../../protocol/papers/protocol-roadmap.md).

## Near Term
