# Introduction

Chain Core is enterprise software that enables institutions to issue and transfer financial assets on permissioned blockchain networks. Using Chain Core, institutions can launch and operate a blockchain network, or connect to a growing list of other networks that are transforming how assets move around the world.

## Chain Core Developer Edition

Chain Core Developer Edition is a free, downloadable version of Chain Core that is [open source](https://github.com/chain/chain) and licensed under [AGPL](https://github.com/chain/chain/blob/main/LICENSE). Individuals and organizations can use Chain Core Developer Edition to learn, experiment, and build prototypes.

Chain Core Developer Edition can run locally on Mac, Windows, or Linux to create a new blockchain network, connect to an existing blockchain network, or connect to the public Chain Testnet, operated by Chain, Microsoft, and Cornell Universityâ€™s IC3.

## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger, is a new type of financial database whose records operate like transferable financial instruments. We refer to these records as digital assets. Unlike a traditional financial database, where one entity is responsible for updating the balances for all participants, a blockchain gives direct control of digital assets to the participants themselves. Each participant maintains a set of private keys that secures their digital assets on a blockchain. When they wish to transfer digital assets to another participant, they must create a ledger update, known as a transaction, and sign it with their private keys. Once the signed transaction is submitted to the blockchain, the ownership of the digital assets is immediately and irreversibly updated for both participants.

The initial issuance of digital assets onto a blockchain is also controlled by cryptographically signed transactions. Each issuer maintains a set of private keys required to issue a specific type of digital asset. A digital asset can represent any unit of value that is defined by the issuer. Chain Core issues all digital assets into a common, interoperable format: government currencies, corporate bonds, loyalty points, IOUs, internal deposits, and more.

Whether the participants on a blockchain are individuals, companies, or systems, and whether asset transfers span countries, companies, or even divisions within a single company, a blockchain offers a secure, trustless way to issue, manage and transfer financial assets.
