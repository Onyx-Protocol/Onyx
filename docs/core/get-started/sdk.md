## Ruby

The Ruby SDK is available [via Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/chain-sdk). Make sure to use the most recent version whose major and minor components (`major.minor.x`) match your version of Chain Core. Ruby 2.1 or greater is required.

For most applications, you can simply add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'chain-sdk', '~> 1.0.0', require: 'chain'
```

## JavaScript

Coming soon. See the [product roadmap](../reference/product-roadmap.md) for details.
