## Introduction

Chain Protocol enables flexible control over assets by supporting custom logic at three levels:

* **Issuance programs**, that specify the rules for issuing new units of an asset.
* **Control programs**, that specify the rules for spending existing units of an asset.
* **Consensus programs**, that specify the rules for accepting new blocks.

Each program authenticates the data structure in which it is used. Programs run deterministically, use capped memory and time requirements, and can be evaluated in parallel.

Programs are flexible enough to allow implementing:

* a wide range of financial instruments (such as options, bonds, and swaps),
* sophisticated security schemes for holding assets,
* and applications such as offers, order books, and auctions.

This document discusses design and use cases for custom programs on the blockchain.

## Chain Virtual Machine

A program is written in bytecode — instructions for the Chain Virtual Machine (CVM). The CVM is a stack machine: each instruction performs operations on a *data stack*, usually working on the items on top of the stack. All items on the data stack are strings of bytes, although some instructions convert them to and from numbers or booleans in order to perform operations on them. The CVM also has an *alt stack* to simplify stack manipulation.

[sidenote]

Bitcoin, similarly, uses programs as predicates in order to determine whether a given state transition — encoded in a transaction — is authorized. This is different from Ethereum’s approach, in which programs directly compute the resulting state.

[/sidenote]

### Stack machine basics

Let’s take a look at a simple program:

    1 2 ADD 3 EQUAL

This program encodes the predicate `1 + 2 == 3`.

The first two instructions are `PUSHDATA` instructions that push their associated values (encoded within the program) on the data stack.

Next, the `ADD` instruction removes the top two values (`1` and `2`), interprets them as integers, adds them together, and pushes the result (`3`) on the stack.

The next instruction is another `PUSHDATA`. This one pushes the number `3`.

Finally, `EQUAL` removes the top two values (the two copies of the number `3`), compares them byte-by-byte, finds them equal, and so pushes the boolean value `true`.


### Run limit

The CVM’s instruction set is Turing complete. To prevent unbounded use of computational resources, the protocol allows networks to set a *run limit* that a program is not allowed to exceed. Each instruction consumes some of the limit as it runs, according to its *run cost*. Simple instructions have a low cost, while processing-intensive instructions, such as signature checks, are more expensive.

[sidenote]

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have restrictions that prevent program execution from using excessive time or memory. Chain’s run limit mechanism is similar to Ethereum’s “gas,” except that there is no on-chain accounting for the execution cost of a transaction.

[/sidenote]

The run cost also takes memory usage into account. Adding an item to the stack has a cost based on the size of the item; removing an item from the stack refunds that cost.


### Instruction set

The CVM has some overlaps and similarities with Bitcoin Script, but adds instructions to support additional functionality, including loops, state transitions (through transaction introspection), and program evaluation.

What follows is a summary of the functionality provided by CVM instructions. For a complete list and more precise definitions, see the [VM specification](../specifications/vm1.md).

#### Stack manipulation

Programs may encode bytestrings to push on the data stack using a range of `PUSHDATA` instructions. Instructions such as `DROP`, `DUP`, `SWAP`, `PICK`, and others allow moving stack items around. More complex stack manipulations can be assisted by `TOALTSTACK` and `FROMALTSTACK` instructions that move items between the data stack and an alternate stack.

#### String manipulation

`EQUAL` checks for the equality of two strings. `CAT`, `SUBSTR`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` perform operations on strings from the top of the stack. `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` perform bitwise operations.

#### Arithmetic operations

While all items on the stack are strings, some instructions interpret items as numbers, using 64-bit two’s complement representation.

The CVM deterministically checks for overflows: if the result overflows (e.g. too-large numbers are multiplied), execution immediately fails.

#### Boolean operations

Items on the stack can also be interpreted as booleans. Empty strings and strings consisting of only `0x00` bytes are interpreted as `false`, all others are `true`.

#### Cryptographic operations

The `SHA256` and `SHA3` instructions execute the corresponding hash functions and output 32-byte strings.

The `CHECKSIG` instruction checks the validity of an Ed25519 signature against a given public key and a message hash.

[sidenote]

While similar to Bitcoin instructions, `CHECKSIG` and `CHECKMULTISIG` are generalized to accept an arbitrary message hash. This enables integration with external authoritative data sources and, more importantly, [signature programs](#signature-programs) discussed below.

[/sidenote]

`CHECKMULTISIG` checks an “M-of-N” signing condition using `M` signatures and `N` public keys.

#### Control flow instructions

`VERIFY` pops the top value from the data stack and checks if it is `true`. If it is not, or if there is no top value, the entire program fails.

`JUMPIF` conditionally jumps to another part of the code, based on the current value on top of the stack. This can be used to implement conditionals and loops.

`CHECKPREDICATE` executes a program (written in CVM bytecode) in a separate VM instance. Nested executions are allowed, but the depth is capped by memory cost that is subtracted from the available run limit and refunded when the nested VM instance completes execution.

#### Introspection instructions

The CVM provides operations that, when used in a control or issuance program, introspect parts of a transaction attempting to spend that output.

[sidenote]

The Ethereum VM includes many instructions that provide introspection into the execution environment, including the global mutable state.

In contrast, CVM allows introspection only of the immutable data declared in the transaction, similar to Bitcoin’s `CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` and `CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` instructions that check absolute and relative transaction lock times, respectively.

[/sidenote]

`CHECKOUTPUT` allows an input to introspect the outputs of the transaction. This allows it to place restrictions on how the input values are subsequently used. This instruction provides functionality similar to the `CHECKOUTPUTVERIFY` instruction proposed by Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gün Sirer in their [Bitcoin Covenants](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/MES16.pdf) paper. `CHECKOUTPUT` also allows implementing arbitrary state-machines within a UTXO model as was proposed by Oleg Andreev in [Pay-to-Contract](https://github.com/oleganza/bitcoin-papers/blob/master/SmartContractsSoftFork.md) paper.

`MINTIME` and `MAXTIME` allow placing limitations on when an output can be spent. `AMOUNT`, `ASSET`, `PROGRAM`, `REFDATAHASH`, and `INDEX` allow a control program to introspect the input itself.


## Ivy

It is easy to write simple programs directly in bytecode thanks to specialized instructions and the simple execution model. However, to design more complex programs that perform transaction introspection and manipulate more data than a few signatures, a higher-level language is needed.

Chain is developing a high-level programming language, *Ivy*, that compiles to CVM bytecode, to make it easier to write and reason about blockchain programs. Ivy is still evolving, and this explanation and tutorial is provided only to help ground the examples used below. Some of the compiled bytecode programs are tweaked for clarity or simplicity.

[sidenote]

Most development for the Ethereum VM is done using [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), a high-level language that has been compared to JavaScript. While Ivy and Solidity have some similarities in syntax, they have very different semantics. Solidity can be classified roughly as an object-oriented imperative language, while Ivy fits better into the paradigm of a *declarative language*. This reflects the design differences between Ethereum’s and Chain’s transaction models.

[/sidenote]


### Conditions

A *condition* in Ivy is a statement that either *fails* or *succeeds*. Each condition begins with `verify` followed by an expression.

    verify 1 + 1 == 2

This condition would compile to the CVM bytecode:

    1 1 + 2 EQUAL VERIFY

A condition fails if the given expression evaluates to `false`.

Ivy supports the same arithmetic, logical, cryptographic, and string operations as the CVM, but uses more familiar infix and function-call syntax.

For example, the following condition:

    verify checksig(publicKey, hash, signature)

is compiled to:

    signature hash publicKey CHECKSIG VERIFY



### Programs

Ivy syntax brings additional structure to programs, making it easy to construct and combine sequences of conditions. Like individual conditions, programs do not change state or return values; they simply succeed or fail.

Here is an example of a control program written in Ivy:

	program SingleKeyProgram(publicKey: PublicKey) {
		path spend(signature: Signature) {
			verify checksig(publicKey, tx.hash, signature)
		}
	}

Let’s break this program down piece by piece.

* Programs can have **parameters**. This program has one parameter, `publicKey`. Values for a program’s parameters, called **arguments**, are specified at the time the program is *instantiated*, or created. In the case of a control program like this, that is the time that an unspent output is added to the blockchain state by a transaction.
* Parameters have **types**—such as PublicKey and Signature. These types help the compiler catch bugs in your programs, and make the code more readable.
* Programs define one or more **paths**. This program has only one path: `spend`. If this control program could be satisfied in different ways, it would have more than one path.
* Each path can define its own parameters. Arguments for path parameters are provided in the input witness. These arguments are passed — and the path is chosen — at the time the program is executed. In the case of a control program like this, that is the time the unspent output is used as an input in a new transaction. This program takes one argument: a `signature`.
* Paths contain one or more **conditions**. This path only uses a single condition, which uses the `CHECKSIG` instruction to check that the provided signature on the hash of the new transaction corresponds to the previously specified public key.

Control and issuance programs have access to a global `tx` variable, which allows them to use the transaction introspection instructions. In this case, `tx.hash` uses the `TXSIGHASH` instruction to get the hash of the new transaction.

    TXSIGHASH SWAP CHECKSIG VERIFY

When the program is instantiated with a `publicKey` value — to be used in an output — the compiler prepends an instruction pushing that value. For example, if the public key used to initialize it is `0xd75a98...`, the script becomes:

	PUSHDATA(0xd75a98...) TXSIGHASH SWAP CHECKSIG VERIFY

When the output is spent and the control program is run:

1. The virtual machine first takes arguments specified in the input witness and pushes them to the stack. In this case, that argument is a signature.
2. The program then executes, first pushing the public key and then the transaction hash to the stack.
3. The public key and transaction hash are then swapped to put them in the correct order for the following `CHECKSIG` instruction.
4. `CHECKSIG` pops all three items off the stack to check the signature, pushing `true` or `false` to the stack.
5. `VERIFY` then pops the top value from the stack and causes the program to fail if the value is `false`. (In an actual control program, the `VERIFY` instruction of the last condition in a path is omitted, since it is performed by the VM itself.)

Many control, issuance, and consensus programs use a multisignature check.

	program MultiKeyProgram(n: Number, m: Number, publicKeys: PublicKey[n]) {
		path spend(signatures: Signature[m]) {
			verify checkmultisig(n, m, publicKeys, tx.hash, signatures)
		}
	}

The `PublicKey[n]` syntax allows an argument to be a list of another type of argument, with a given length.


### Composing programs

Normally, when a control program is added to the blockchain, its logic and any public keys it contains are available immediately to all observers. What if we don't want to reveal our public keys or logic when the control program is first put on the blockchain, but only when and if it is spent? The control program could commit to a *hash* of the actual program, with the actual program passed as an argument later and then evaluated.

[sidenote]

Bitcoin supports a similar pattern, known as “[Pay to Script Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0013.mediawiki)”

[/sidenote]

	program HashedProgram(programHash: Hash) {
		path spend(program: Program, arguments: Arguments) {
			verify sha3(string(program)) == programHash
			verify program(arguments)
		}
	}

This technique is useful for describing and developing generic patterns for control programs and as a result is used throughout the rest of this guide.

Programs *themselves* can instantiate programs with arguments to create new programs. In combination with output introspection, this allows construction of complex state machines.

This is examined in more detail in the [examples](#examples) below.



## Program functionality

Chain Protocol uses programs in three contexts:

* **Transferring assets** using control programs.
* **Issuing assets** using issuance programs.
* **Signing blocks** using consensus programs.

### Control programs

Control programs define the conditions for spending assets on a blockchain.

Control programs are sometimes called **addresses**.

Control programs are specified in a transaction output, which also specifies an asset ID and amount. That value is stored on the blockchain in an unspent transaction output (UTXO). To spend that value, someone can create a transaction that uses that unspent output as the source of one of its inputs, as long as they can provide arguments that cause the control program to succeed.

Examples of control programs are described above.


### Issuance programs

Issuance programs define the rules for issuing new units of an asset onto the blockchain.

The issuance program for a given type of asset is fixed when the asset ID is first defined. The issuance program is part of the data structure hashed to create the asset ID, and therefore cannot be changed.

To issue units of an asset, an issuer creates a transaction with one or more issuance inputs specifying some amount of that asset to be issued. Arguments can be passed in the input witness.

A simple issuance program might just check one or more signatures on the transaction doing the issuance. It would therefore look a lot like the control program described above, with only program and path names changed to match the issuance context:

    program MultisigIssuanceProgram(n: Number, m: Number, publickeys: PublicKey[n]) {
    	path issue(signatures: Signature[m]) {
    		verify checkmultisig(n, m, publicKeys, tx.hash, signatures)
    	}
    }

### Consensus programs

Consensus programs define the rules for accepting a new block.

Each block includes the consensus program that must be satisfied by the *next* block.

Chain’s [federated consensus protocol](federated-consensus.md) relies on a quorum of block signers signing the hash of the block. The consensus program can therefore look a lot like the multisignature issuance and control programs described above:

    program ConsensusProgram(n: Number, m: Number, publickeys: PublicKey[n]) {
    	path checkBlock(signatures: Signature[m]) {
    		verify checkmultisig(n, m, publicKeys, block.hash, signatures)
    	}
    }

### Signature programs

CVM and Ivy also enable a powerful new way to authorize transactions.

In the above examples of control programs and issuance programs, asset holders and issuers authorize transactions by signing a hash that commits to the entire transaction. This is the typical way that authorization works in UTXO-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

[sidenote]

Bitcoin provides “signature hash types” that offer some of the functionality described below. Unfortunately, signature types are relatively inflexible and complex, and are rarely used in practice.

[/sidenote]

Signing the entire transaction hash is fine if you only want to authorize an input to be spent in a particular transaction. However, what if you only know or care about a particular part of a transaction at the time you sign it?

For example, suppose Alice wants to sell **5 Acme shares** to Bob, in exchange for **10 USD**. Alice wants to authorize the transfer of her Acme shares if and only if she receive payment of 10 USD to her own address. However, Alice does not care what the other input in the transaction will be — i.e., where the other payment will come from. If Alice sends the partially filled transaction to Bob to allow him to fill out the rest, he will have to return it to her to examine (verifying that it pays her the 10 USD she expects) and then sign.

Instead of authorizing a specific transaction, it would be useful if a spender or issuer could preauthorize *any* transaction as long as it meets certain criteria.

To enable this, the control program for Alice’s Acme shares cannot have the simple form described above, which checks a signature against the transaction hash, since at the time Alice signs it, the transaction is still incomplete and its hash is therefore not yet known. Instead, the control program should look like this:

    program AliceAccount(publicKey: PublicKey) {
    	path spend(signature: Signature, prog: Program, arguments: Arguments) {
    		verify checksig(publicKey, prog, signature)
    		verify prog(arguments)
    	}
    }

In this program, the spender provides a signature of an entirely new *program*, which is then evaluated (with any given arguments). The combined signature and program are referred to as a *signature program*.

The signature program can use transaction introspection to set conditions on particular parts of the transaction.

For example:

    program TransactionHashCheck(targetHash: Hash) {
    	path check() {
    		verify tx.hash == targetHash
    	}
    }

This program turns a signature program into a traditional signature by committing to a specific transaction hash. This is useful if Alice wants to move funds between accounts or make a simple payment. To do that, she would:

1. compose the target transaction,
2. compute its hash,
3. instantiate a `TransactionHashCheck` program with that hash,
4. sign the program,
5. place the program and the signature in the input witness to authorize the target transaction.

But a signature program can do much more than that. For example, this program solves the “exchange” problem described above:

    program ExchangeProgram(targetOutputIndex: Number, targetAmount: Number, targetAssetID: AssetID, targetControlProgram: Program) {
    	path exchange() {
    		verify tx.outputs[targetOutputIndex] == (targetAmount, targetAssetID, targetControlProgram)
    	}
    }

If this program is initialized with the details of the desired output — say, **10 USD** sent to Alice’s new address — and signed with Alice’s private key, the combined signature program will authorize Alice’s input to be spent only in a transaction that includes the desired output.

[sidenote]

Christopher Allen and Shannon Appelcline explore ideas similar to signature programs in their working paper on “[Smart Signatures](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/draft-documents/smarter-signatures.md).”

[/sidenote]


## Examples

Using the building blocks described above, it is possible to implement financial applications that are enforced by the network (so-called "smart contracts").

The examples that follow are provided as illustrations only. They gloss over some subtleties and should not be considered final or secure.

### Offers

The following control program implements an open offer to sell the controlled assets to anyone who pays the specified price to the seller's address:

    program Offer(askingPrice: Number, currency: AssetID, sellerProgram: Program) {
    	path lift(paymentIndex: Number) {
    		verify tx.outputs[paymentIndex] == (askingPrice, currency, sellerProgram)
    	}
    }

That program will be on the blockchain until someone satisfies it with a corresponding payment. What if we want to make it revocable by the seller?

    program RevocableOffer(askingPrice: Number, currency: AssetID, sellerProgram: Program) {
    	path lift(paymentIndex: Number) {
    		verify tx.outputs[paymentIndex] == (askingPrice, currency, sellerProgram)
    	}
    	path cancel(arguments: Arguments) {
    		verify sellerProgram(arguments)
    	}
    }

The offer can be made irrevocable for a certain period of time, and then automatically expire after some later point.

    program TimeLimitedOffer(askingPrice: Number, currency: AssetID, sellerProgram: Program, revocabilityTime: Time, expirationTime: Time) {
    	path lift(paymentIndex: Number) {
    		verify tx.maxtime < expirationTime
    		verify tx.outputs[paymentIndex] == (askingPrice, currency, sellerProgram)
    	}
    	path cancel(arguments: Arguments) {
    		verify tx.mintime > revocabilityTime
    		verify sellerProgram(arguments)
    	}
    }

What if we want to be able to fill a *partial* order, allowing someone to pay for part of the program and leaving the rest available for someone else to purchase?

    program PartiallyFillableOffer(pricePerUnit: number, currency: AssetID, sellerProgram: Program) {
    	path lift(purchasedAmount: Number, paymentIndex: Number, remainderIndex: Number) {
    		verify purchasedAmount > 0
    		verify tx.outputs[paymentIndex] == (purchasedAmount * pricePerUnit, currency, sellerProgram)
    		verify tx.outputs[remainderIndex] == (tx.currentInput.amount - purchasedAmount,
    											  tx.currentInput.asset,
    											  tx.currentInput.program)
    	}
    	path cancel(arguments: Arguments) {
    		verify sellerProgram(arguments)
    	}
    }

Notice that the remainder must be sent to a new program that is a duplicate of the current one, just controlling fewer assets.


### State Machines

What if you want to get more complex than just replicating the same program, but want to change its state when you do? This is where the program model really shines. Programs can instantiate programs with new arguments on the fly.

This program will prevent its assets from being transferred more than once within a certain time period:

    program OncePerPeriod(authorizationPredicate: Program, lastSpend: Time, period: Duration) {
    	path spend(index: Number, arguments: Arguments) {
    		// check that the spending is otherwise authorized
    		// this could be a signature check
    		verify authorizationPredicate(arguments)

    		// check that at least one day has passed
    		verify tx.mintime > lastSpend

    		nextControlProgram = OncePerPeriod(authorizationPredicate,
    										   tx.maxtime,
    										   period)

    		verify tx.outputs[index] == (tx.currentInput.amount,
    								 tx.currentInput.asset,
    								 nextControlProgram)
    	}
    }


### Singletons

While most state should be tracked locally in the program-level arguments for a specific unspent output, some on-chain use cases may require keeping track of “global” state. For example, one may want to limit issuance of an asset, so only 100 units can be issued per day. This can be done using the *singleton* design pattern.

First, one needs to create an asset for which only one unit can ever be issued. This requires some understanding of how the Chain Protocol handles issuances. Unique issuance — ensuring that issuances cannot be replayed — is a challenging problem that is outside the scope of this paper. The Chain Protocol’s solution is that each issuance input has a nonce that, when combined with the transaction’s `mintime`, `maxtime`, and asset ID, must be unique throughout the blockchain’s history. As a result, an issuance *program* can ensure that it is only used once by committing to a specific nonce, transaction mintime, and transaction maxtime:

    program SinglyIssuableAssetSingletonToken(nonce: String, mintime: Time, maxtime: Time, amount: Number, lockProgram: Program) {
    	path issue(outputIndex: Number) {
    		// ensure that asset can only be issued once
    		verify nonce == tx.currentInput.nonce
    		verify mintime == tx.mintime
    		verify maxtime == tx.maxtime

    		// ensure that only one unit is issued
    		verify tx.currentInput.amount == 1

    		// ensure that the issued unit is locked with the target lockProgram
    		verify tx.outputs[outputIndex] == (tx.currentInput.amount,
    										   tx.currentInput.asset,
    										   lockProgram)
    	}
    }

This means there will only be one unspent output on the blockchain with this asset ID at a given time. As a result, it can be used as a *singleton* — a token to keep track of some piece of global state for other asset IDs.

The `lockProgram` parameter of this program determines the rules that will govern the token.

For example, we've already seen the `OncePerPeriod` program. If that program is used as the “lock program”, the singleton token can be prevented from being spent more than once in a particular amount of time.

How does that help us with metered issuance? We can create a separate asset with an issuance program that checks that the singleton is also spent in the same transaction, and that no more than a given amount is issued.

    program MeteredAssetIssuanceProgram(authorizationPredicate: Program, singletonAssetID: AssetID, maxAmount: Number) {
    	path issue(singletonControlProgram: Program, singletonIndex: Number, arguments: Arguments) {
    		// check that the issuance is otherwise authorized
    		verify authorizationPredicate(arguments)

    		// check that no more than the max amount is being issued
    		verify tx.currentInput.amount < maxAmount

    		// check that the singleton token is being spent
    		// its index and control program don't need to be checked
    		// which is why they are passed as arguments
    		verify tx.outputs[singletonIndex] == (1,
    										   singletonAssetID,
    										   singletonControlProgram)
    	}
    }


### Private Programs

Programs on the blockchain are made secure because the entire network may verify correctness of their execution. This necessarily means that all data necessary for execution is made public. But what if parties to a contract wish to avoid revealing sensitive parameters (such as prices, interest rates, deadlines etc)? They can achieve a level of privacy by adding an additional path that lets all interested parties spend the output without revealing the path that actually enforces the contract:

    program PrivateControlProgram(programHash: Hash, n: Number, publicKeys: PublicKeys[n]) {
    	path settle(signatures: Signature[n]) {
    		// all interested parties can agree to the final result of the program
    		verify checkmultisig(n, n, publicKeys, tx.hash, signatures)
    	}
    	path enforce(prog: Program, arguments: Arguments) {
    		// any party can reveal the program and enforce it
    		verify sha3(prog) == programHash
    		verify prog(arguments)
    	}
    }

Parties can evaluate the program privately, determine the result, mutually agree to how it should resolve, and provide their signatures on the resulting transaction. If any party refuses to agree to the result, another party can enforce the program by making its code public. This is similar to how contract enforcement works in the real world: details can remain private unless and until disputes have to be settled in court.

[sidenote]

This idea can be extended to implement full [Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees](http://www.mit.edu/~jlrubin/public/pdfs/858report.pdf) — programs for which unexecuted branches do not need to be revealed. Similar ideas have also been explored by so-called “payment channels” in Bitcoin, most famously in the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) project, as well as “[state channels](http://www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/)” in Ethereum.

## Conclusion

The Chain Protocol enables flexible control over assets through programmatic conditions that govern both issuance and transfer, as well as integrity of the ledger. Programs are executed by a Chain Virtual Machine with a Turing-complete instruction set. Programs are evaluated as predicates in a restricted, stateless environment that ensures safety and scalability. Programs can use powerful transaction introspection instructions that allow building sophisticated smart contracts and state machines. To make it more efficient to design programs, Chain is developing Ivy, a high-level programming language that compiles to CVM bytecode.
