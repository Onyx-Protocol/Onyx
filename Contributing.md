Hello from Chain!

For all product or technical questions, please review or post to Chain's [forum](http://forums.chain.com/). 

Chain uses Github issues to track bugs in Chain Core. If you have a bug to report, please check Chain's [forum](http://forums.chain.com/) first to see if it's already under discussion by the Chain community, then check the [open issues list](https://github.com/chain/chain/issues) to see whether it has already been reported there.

Pull requests may not receive the attention they deserve, since we are a focused team with a product roadmap. However, if you have found a way to help out the Chain Core community by submitting a bugfix, we'll do our best to work with you to get your code merged.
