/*

Command corectl provides miscellaneous control functions for a Chain Core.

The database connection can be configured using the DATABASE_URL environment
variable; the default is to connect to the "core" database on localhost.

The config commands initialize the schema if necessary.

Migrate

Subcommand 'migrate' applies any pending database migrations, ensuring
the database has an up-to-date schema.

	corectl migrate

Config Generator

Subcommand 'config-generator' configures a new core as a generator.
It matches the dashboard's behavior when writing the config,
but with additional functionality.

	corectl config-generator [-s] [-w duration] [quorum] [pubkey url]...

Flag -s sets this core as a signer.

Flag -w, followed by a duration string (e.g. "24h"), sets the maximum issuance window.
The default is 24 hours.

Config Participant

Subcommand 'config' configures the Core as a non-generator. It requires a
blockchain ID and the corresponding generator URL. Optionally, it takes
the public key of a block signing key if the Core is to be configured
as a signer.

	corectl config [-t token] [-k pubkey] [blockchain-id] [url]

Flag -t provides an access token to authenticate with the generator.

Flag -k causes the core to be a block signer.
Its argument is the local public key for signing blocks.
If -k is not given, the core will be a participant (not a generator or a signer).

Create Block Keypair

Subcommand 'create-block-keypair' generates a new keypair in the MockHSM for block signing,
with the alias "block_key".

    corectl create-block-keypair

Create Access Token

Subcommand 'create-token' generates a new access token with the given name.
Flag -net means to create a network token,
otherwise it will create a client token.

    corectl create-token [-net] [name]

Reset

Subcommand 'reset' resets the database so the Chain Core can be configured again.
It deletes all data.

    corectl reset
