# Chain Ruby SDK

## 1.0.3 (March 2, 2017)

* Relax minimum Ruby version requirement from 2.1 to 2.0. While the Ruby SDK is now compatible with Ruby 2.0, we strongly recommend using Ruby 2.1 or greater, since Ruby 2.0 has reached end-of-life and is no longer receiving critical security updates.

## 1.0.2 (February 21, 2017)

* Syntax compatibility update

## 1.0.1 (January 24, 2017)

* Set minimum Ruby version requirement to 2.1
* Enhanced transaction feed API support
* Fixed issue reading attributers with array getter syntax (@donce in [#422](https://github.com/chain/chain/pull/422))

## 1.0.0 (November 17, 2016)

* Initial release
